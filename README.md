# Test_documentation

## Description
The folder contains a command-line tool for fusing documentation into code from various languages.

## Overview
The Test_documentation repository is created to house a command-line tool specifically designed for merging documentation into code written in different programming languages. The primary objective of this tool is to streamline the process of integrating documentation with code, making it easier for developers to understand the functionality and implementation details of the codebase. By utilizing this tool, developers can maintain a consistent and organized documentation structure across multiple programming languages, enhancing code readability and collaboration among team members. The tool provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to specify the desired documentation format and the target programming language. It then automatically generates the necessary code comments and annotations, seamlessly integrating documentation into the codebase. With this tool, developers can save significant time and effort in manually managing and updating documentation, enabling them to focus more on coding and delivering high-quality software products.
